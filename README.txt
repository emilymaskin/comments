The file comments.png illustrates a tree of comments.

As the FE lead on this project, you're tasked with:

1. Building and styling this module to precisely match the UI.

2. Implementing the following interaction states:
	a) Hovering over each comment should reveal a delete(x) icon (as shown).
	b) Clicking on this delete icon should remove the comment and its descendants from the list.
	c) Clicking the reply link should reveal a comment form (as shown).
	d) Posting a new comment from this form should create a new nested comment.
		- No errors states are necessary for this build.
		- No server-side functionality is required.
			- Instead, how would you prototype creating a new comment using data at the front-end?

3. How would you build out this application in a way that can be re-usable across different areas?
